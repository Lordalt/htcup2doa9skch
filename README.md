# htcup2doa9skch
htcup2doa9skch project (htc u play to desire one a9s kernel conversion hopefully project)is my attempt to port the kernel of the htc u play to the htc desire one a9s. Now you might be asking: why? well becuse we (as in the community)didn't get the kernel source code for the a9s but we did for a very similar phone the u play. if and or when i get it to work i will try to make a rom for the a9s but that will come when it is the time for that.
# how could i help?
i am very new to this github stuff so i dont know yet how you can help, but if you have something that could help then just idk tell me on here: https://discord.gg/bUtCpCm5V8.
# currently im looking for people who could help with the dumping of the stock rom from the a9s. if you think you know how to then shoot me an message in the discord link above.
# i currently dont have either the a9s (but i know someone who does) or the u play so if you want to be of any help join the discord.
# im  currently unsure wether im able to do this without owning either device, and as such im suspending this project. 
# DO NOT DOWNLOAD ANY OF THE SOURCE FROM HERE AS THEY ARE BOTH INCOMPLETE AND MODIFIED SLIGHTLY, GET THE SOURCE FOR THE U PLAY FROM HERE https://www.htcdev.com/.
